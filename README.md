# Description of website
I created this website to showcase the developer skills I have learned so far in a setting that I hope to continue expanding on.
The site contains multiple pages right now that I hope to fill and improve as my coding skills improve, but as of right now the most significant pages are the About Me page and the styling of the landing page.

## About Me
This about me page provides a simple and "iceberg" summary of the basics of who I am and what my interests are.
